## Description

Funding the Future is designed to revolutionize the way innovative projects receive financial backing. The platform's mission is to enable the discovery and funding of groundbreaking ideas, particularly in open-source projects and independent applications. It aims to create a bridge between visionary creators and supportive patrons globally.

In a world brimming with innovative ideas, many potentially transformative projects lack the necessary financial support. "Funding the Future" seeks to fill this gap by connecting creative talents with funding opportunities.

Funding the Future aims to catalyze the growth of innovative projects, contributing to technological advancement and economic growth on a global scale, establishing a new standard for community-driven project funding.

With the use of Frames, we're making it easier than ever for projects to be discovered and supported. Farcaster users can directly pledge to projects they find in a frame.

## Tech Stack

Next.js: We used Next.js to create our dApp, which facilitates client-side interaction with Ethereum blockchain using wagmi. This integration is crucial for executing transactions, interacting with smart contracts, and retrieving blockchain data directly from the user's browser.

Privy Integration: We integrate Privy for authentication to ensure a seamless login experience. Privy offers a decentralized approach, allowing users to authenticate without traditional passwords, reducing friction and enhancing security.

Base's OnchainKit Utilization: We leverage Base's OnchainKit to scaffold and manage the underlying blockchain frames. This toolkit streamlines the development of blockchain-related functionalities, enabling robust and scalable infrastructure.

Smart Contract Development with Solidity: The core of our platform's functionality is driven by smart contracts written in Solidity. These contracts handle all on-platform transactions, from funding operations to the distribution of funds, ensuring transparent and trustless interactions.
